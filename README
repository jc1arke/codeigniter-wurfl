CodeIgniter WURFL Wrapper Class

Needs the WURFL API from:
http://m.wurflpro.com/~wurfl/php/

Put the WURFL directory into your libraries directory,
either in your applications directory, or in the 
main system directory.

Put wurfl-config.xml into your application's config
directory, and modify as needed.

If you are using file storage as the caching method,
you may need to make the cache directory set in
wurfl-config.xml writable.

You will also need to define where wurfl.xml and
web_browsers_patch.xml are located.

You can use the following code:

<?php
$this->load->library('wurfl');
$this->wurfl->load('USER_AGENT_HERE');
?>

You can also pass the $_SERVER variable to $this->wurfl->load()

To get capabilities, you should do the following:
$this->wurfl->getCapability('max_data_rate');
OR
$this->wurfl->getAllCapabilities();

There are other methods available, which should be 
fairly self explanatory.
